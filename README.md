# Kmeans
Kmeans-Algorithm
In this repository the implementation of Kmeans is provided.

Two implementetios are provided,one using arrays only and another one using structs.
The arrays only,implementetion in "p3.c" file creates the dataset in main function.
The dataset in which the algorithm runs is created with the function createDatasetII() in main function.
Comment that line of code after first run, for running the algorithm with the same Dataset.

The struct implementetion in "Kmeans.c" is followed by another file the "MakeFile.c" which creates the Dataset,
in which the algorithm runs.Run first the MakeFile.c, to get your dataset.

Each implementetion after running provides two ".txt" files.One with the Center of each "team",
and one with every point on that team.In the beggining of the code, we define how many teams we want to create.

A brief explanation of the "p3.c" file is provided in "K-Means.pdf".(For now in Greek only.)
